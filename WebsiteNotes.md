I just had a random brain thought and was like "Wow I Love Arcade Controllers" so here we are <br>
The red and pink contrasting with the white looks pretty nice, and the darker tones of red look better than black <br>
This was the first time I actually enjoyed using grid, which made the controllers, games, and gallery pages pretty nice <br>
I just did some cool little css things to make the fade in animation, and other than that it is a pretty simple website :D
